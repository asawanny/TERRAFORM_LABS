- [ ] Search for *EC2* in search bar *New*.
- [ ] Click *Instances* -> *Launch Instance* on the left side menu.
- [ ] Give your instance a name such as *yourname_surname_webserver* 
        -> Use *Amazon Linux* as OS  
        -> *t2.micro* as Instance type  
        -> Use *Amazon Linux*  
        -> Proceed without a key pair

    ## This role will give access permissions to access S3 service from EC2 instance ##

        -> Under Advanced details, IAM Instance profile-> choose EC2Instance-Role

If you get a access denied error, Click on the EC2 instance-> Actions ->Security -> Modify IAM Role -> Add EC2Instance-Role and save. Now, try again to create a bucket
 
## Enable Public access to S3 Bucket from EC2 Instance ##

    --bucket your-bucket-name \
    --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=false,IgnorePublicAcls=false,BlockPublicPolicy=false,RestrictPublicBuckets=false"

    Replace your-bucket-name to name of your bucket. Use Notepad to modify Bucket name 

## Create index.html file inside the EC2 instance using vim editor ##
